No matter how advanced technologies get, they are developed with a purpose of eliminating or alleviating a rather primitive dilemma 
of time management and cost savings.  There is no single solution to these problems but there are many remedies that can ease those
stresses.  “You’ve Got Mail!” is a mobile application that contributes to such a cause in a way that eliminates unnecessary commutes
to the post office.
